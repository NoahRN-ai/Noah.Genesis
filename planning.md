# Project Noah MVP V1.0 - Planning

This document outlines the project's structure, conventions, and the AI's understanding of core requirements.

## 1. Role Assignment & Mission Imperative

The AI (Jules) is designated as the **Primary Code Generation & Configuration Engine** for **Project Noah MVP V1.0**. Its core function is to execute detailed, task-specific instructions from `AEM-Engineer_Noah_MVP_Builder_v1.0` with precision, velocity, and adherence to project specifications.

## 2. Critical Context Documents

The following documents form the absolute source of truth for this project:

*   `TA_Noah_MVP_v1.1` (Technical Architecture)
*   `PB_Noah_Genesis_V1.1_AI_Optimized` (Project Brief & MVP Feature Set)
*   `STER_MVP_v1_LLM_Assessment v0.1` (Core LLM Strategy)
*   "Project Noah MVP V1.0: AI Agent Development - Final IDE Prompting Guide" (Definitive Task Execution Guide)
*   `Architecting.txt` ("Architecting an AI Agent Nurse on Google Cloud")
*   `Logos_Accord_vCurrent_Stable` (Guiding Ethical Framework)
*   "Noah_Vision_MVP_v1"
*   "Project Genesis: noah.rn AI Agent Nurse Development Directive"
*   "Project Noah - Vision & MVP Reset - May 2025"

## 3. Core Operational & Engineering Directives

Key operational principles:

*   **Radical Velocity & MVP Focus:** `BUILD_WORKING_MVP_FAST`.
*   **MuskOS Engineering Principles:** Simplicity, cleanliness, maximal effectiveness.
*   **Strict Adherence to Specifications:** Conform to `TA_Noah_MVP_v1.1`, `PB_Noah_Genesis_V1.1_AI_Optimized`, and the "Final IDE Prompting Guide."
*   **Modularity & CRITICAL Documentation Standard:** Highly modular code with extensive Google Style Python docstrings and detailed Markdown documentation for all significant artifacts.

## 4. Technological Stack

*   **Backend:** Python, FastAPI, LangGraph
*   **Frontend:** React+TypeScript, Vite
*   **Cloud Platform:** Google Cloud Platform (Cloud Run, Vertex AI, Firestore, Cloud Storage, etc. as per `TA_Noah_MVP_v1.1`)

## 5. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

*   **Terraform:** Strong default for GCP resource management.
*   **gcloud CLI Scripts:** Permissible only if Terraform demonstrably impedes radical velocity for a critical MVP component (must be justifiable and pre-agreed if impacting shared state).

## 6. HIPAA Compliance

All data handling, storage, and processing logic must strictly align with HIPAA guidelines referenced in project documents.

## 7. Anticipated Workflow & Output Structure

*   Project execution will follow distinct phases (Setup, Backend, Frontend, LLM/Agent Integration, Compliance/Testing/Deployment).
*   Specific, actionable prompts will be provided for each task.
*   Outputs will include Python code, Terraform files, gcloud scripts, Poetry files, Makefiles/justfiles, pre-commit hooks, Dockerfiles, Cloud Build YAMLs, and extensive Markdown documentation.
*   All outputs are destined for the `Noah.Genesis` GitHub repository, following a precise directory structure specified in the "Final IDE Prompting Guide."
