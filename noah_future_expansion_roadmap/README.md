# Noah AI-Powered Dynamic Nursing Report - Future Expansion Roadmap

This directory contains documentation outlining potential future development paths and advanced features for the Noah system, beyond the scope of the initial Minimum Viable Products (MVPs).

## File Index

1.  **`future_expansion_roadmap.md`**
    *   **Purpose:** This markdown document provides a high-level overview of potential long-term enhancements for the Noah AI-Powered Dynamic Nursing Report.
    *   **Content:**
        *   **Introduction:** Briefly sets the context of post-MVP development.
        *   **Advanced AI in Systems Assessment (Section V):** Details numerous AI-driven features for deeper analysis and prediction within each physiological system assessment (e.g., predictive alerts for respiratory distress, automated pressure injury risk alerts, early arrhythmia detection). It also lists potential Google Cloud services that could support these features (e.g., Vertex AI, Pub/Sub, Vision AI, Healthcare NLP API).
        *   **Predictive Insights & Risk Alerts (Section VIII - Full Implementation):** Describes the full scope of proactive risk assessment, including continuous calculation of scores like SOFA, qSOFA, NEWS/MEWS, and alerts for potential drug interactions, mapping these to services like Vertex AI and Recommendations AI.
        *   **Simulation Sandbox (Section X):** Outlines "What-If" scenario capabilities, allowing for simulation of physiological responses and use in training, referencing services like Vertex AI Workbench and potentially custom simulation engines (e.g., "NovaSim").
        *   **Enhanced AI Agent Framework:** Discusses maturing the agent orchestration (e.g., full LangGraph implementation), developing a more sophisticated Clinical Knowledge Agent, and advancing NLP capabilities, pointing to services like Knowledge AI and Dialogflow.
        *   **Data Infrastructure Maturation:** Covers full EMR integration, robust data governance (Dataplex), secure PHI handling (Cloud DLP), and scalable data warehousing (BigQuery, Cloud Healthcare API).
        *   **Conclusion:** Emphasizes the long-term nature of these goals.

## Purpose of this Directory

The `future_expansion_roadmap.md` file is intended to serve as a guiding document for future planning and development phases of the Noah project. It captures ambitious ideas and maps them to potential technologies, providing a vision for how the system can evolve into a more comprehensive and intelligent clinical support tool.

This is **not** an active development plan for the current MVP stages but rather a look ahead to what could be built upon a successful foundation.
