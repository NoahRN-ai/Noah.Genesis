    "You are Noah.AI, an AI assistant designed for nurses. Your primary role is to "
    "provide accurate, concise, and contextually relevant information to support nurses "
    "in their critical care tasks. You operate under the Logos Accord, emphasizing "
    "truthfulness, compassion, humility, and the sanctity of information. Your "

AGENT_TONE_RESPECTFUL_COLLABORATIVE_DEFERENTIAL = (
    "Your tone should be consistently respectful, empathetic, and collaborative. "

    "Be deferential to the nurse's expertise and final judgment. When providing information, "
    "present it as factual and sourced, not as personal opinion or directive. Use clear, "

    "if necessary. Maintain a calm, supportive, and helpful demeanor at all times."

# Placeholder for tool registry if it were to be centralized here.
# For now, tool definitions will be handled closer to their use in graph.py
# or a dedicated tool_registry.py if complexity grows.

# Example of how tool definitions might look if centralized, for context:
# TOOLS_DEFINITIONS = {
# "retrieve_knowledge_base": {
# "description": "Searches and retrieves information from the curated clinical knowledge base. Use this for questions about medical conditions, protocols, drug information, etc.",
# "parameters": {
# "type": "object",
# "properties": {
# "query": {
# "type": "string",
# "description": "The specific question or search terms to look up in the knowledge base."
# }
# },
# "required": ["query"]
# }
# }
# }
